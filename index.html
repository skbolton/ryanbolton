      <h4>I’m a mortgage consultant and lender based in St. George, Utah</h4>
      <p>I started my career in 1999 and since that time I have seen and done it all. I have helped provide mortgage and real estate financing for first-time buyers, real estate investors, seasoned home owners, self-employed entrepreneurs, and those who are looking to refinance. I moved to St. George in 2005 and love this beautiful area.</p>
      <p>My crucial experience, open communication, and problem-solving skills, combined with the unsurpassed processing, underwriting, and closing teams of Synergy One Lending give me the tools and confidence <strong>to offer the best possible loans for my clients.</strong></p>
      <p><strong><em>I truly enjoy what I do for a living.</em></strong></p>

          I found Ryan to be both honest, reliable, and a reasonable person to work with. I would highly recommend his services. In fact, I am using him again to refi one of my rental properties

          His knowledge of the business is like no one I've ever used
        </header>
          I have bought and sold over a million dollars of property over the past eight years. I utilized Ryan for my last transaction. I can honestly say that Ryan exceeded my expectations ten fold. Ryan responds to emails and phone calls immediately. His knowledge of the business is like no one I’ve ever used. I did not know Ryan prior to my last transaction. I heard his ad on the radio. I was in need of a loan officer in Utah at the time. I would highly recommend Ryan. I am a client for life.
